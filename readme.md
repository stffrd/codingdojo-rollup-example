# Coding Dojo Rollup Example

This is an example build tool using rollup and svelte and hey guess what it's not perfect or shiny but FIGHT ME. POKE AROUND IN IT. 

## Getting Started

- Pull this repo down. 
- `npm install`
- You'll need rollup installed globally, so `npm install -g rollup`
- `rollup -c --watch` will start the hot-reloading process (unless I'm awful)
- Poke around! Change stuff! See if it works for you!
